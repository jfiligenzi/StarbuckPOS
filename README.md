# StarbuckPOS
This application is designed to allow for Starbucks employees to get better acquainted with drink recipes and the processes behind making them. Along with the goal for future development of mimicking the POS allowing for practice with customer connection and engagement.

This software is to be used in a training setting along with allowing users to implement their own personal drinks if they're struggling with anything. This software is new in its field as there is no training software available to new Starbucks that is hands on like the real thing.

Current working features:

- Name changed to SpaceBux to avoid copyright
- All drinks are stored in a data file
- Read/Write, and Sort features are available through main or editing the file itself
- inorder traversal searching using recursion allowing for you to find orders based on the customers name <--- improvement of my choice
- A queue handles the current drinks in the order with a hashtable checking to see if a last name is needed
- Networking enabled printing feature that will print a list of drinks right to your printer!
- A fancy BST that stores all the transactions
- Other general features include ArrayList data structures, linked lists, color coded GUI
- debug button is used for printing to console
